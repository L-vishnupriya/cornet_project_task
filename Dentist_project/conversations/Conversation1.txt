Conversation 1: Noisy Dental Conversation – Root Canal

Date: Wednesday, December 17, 2025

Dentist: Dr. Alexander Vance
Patient: Mr. David Miller

Dr. Vance: Good morning, David. Uh… good to see you again. I hear you’re having some trouble with one of your teeth. Can you tell me what’s been going on?

David: Yeah, doctor. Um… it started maybe, like, four days ago? At first it was just a little sensitivity when I drank cold water. I thought it would go away, but, uh, yesterday it got really bad. It’s this constant throbbing pain on the lower right side.

Dr. Vance: Okay, lower right. And how bad is the pain right now? If ten is the worst pain you can imagine?

David: Right now it’s around a seven, I’d say. But when I bite down—oh man—it jumps to, like, a nine or even a ten. It also feels like that tooth is… uh… kind of higher than the others.

Dr. Vance: That’s actually helpful information. That “high” feeling usually means there’s pressure under the tooth. Let me take a look. Open wide for me.
Alright, I’m going to tap on a few teeth here. Let me know when it hurts.

David: Okay.

Dr. Vance: [taps nearby tooth] How about this one?

David: No, that one’s okay.

Dr. Vance: [taps tooth #30] And this one?

David: Oh—yeah, yeah, that’s it. That one really hurts.

Dr. Vance: Alright. We did take an X-ray just before I came in. Let’s look at it together on the screen.
You see this dark spot here, at the very tip of the root? That shadow means there’s an infection—what we call a dental abscess.

David: So… does that mean the tooth is dead or something?

Dr. Vance: Essentially, yes. The nerve inside the tooth—the pulp—has become necrotic, meaning it’s no longer alive. The official diagnosis is symptomatic apical periodontitis. Basically, bacteria got inside the tooth and your body is reacting to it.

David: Okay… that sounds serious. What do we do next?

Dr. Vance: To save the tooth, the best option is a root canal. I know people worry about that, but honestly, with today’s anesthesia, it’s no worse than getting a deep filling.
We clean out the infection, disinfect the canals, and seal everything up.

David: I’m mostly worried about the pain during the procedure.

Dr. Vance: That’s totally understandable. We’ll make sure you’re numb. But because there’s an active infection right now, I want to calm things down first with medication before we start the actual root canal work.

David: Alright. What medicines will I need to take?

Dr. Vance: Okay, so I’m prescribing three things. Let me explain them slowly.

First, Amoxicillin—uh—five hundred milligrams. That’s 500 mg. You’ll take one capsule every… eight hours, so three times a day, for a full seven days. Even if you feel better in two or three days, please finish all of it.

Second, Ibuprofen, six hundred milligrams. Take one tablet every six hours for pain and swelling.

And third, if the pain is still bad, you can take Acetaminophen, five hundred milligrams, in between the Ibuprofen doses. Just don’t take them at the exact same time.

David: Okay… so Amoxicillin three times a day, Ibuprofen every six hours, and Tylenol in between if needed.

Dr. Vance: Exactly. Now, we should schedule the root canal. Let’s see… today is Wednesday.
How about Tuesday, December twenty-third, uh, around nine in the morning? Officially it’s 9:00 AM.

David: Yeah, that should work for me.

Dr. Vance: Good. Until then, try to avoid chewing on the right side. Stick to soft foods. Also avoid really hot or really cold drinks—they can make the pressure worse.

David: What if the swelling gets worse before Tuesday?

Dr. Vance: Good question. If you notice swelling spreading toward your eye or down your neck, or if you have trouble breathing or swallowing, that’s an emergency—don’t wait. Otherwise, with the antibiotics, you should start feeling some relief within, say, twenty-four to maybe forty-eight hours.

David: Alright. That makes sense. Thank you, doctor.

Dr. Vance: You’re welcome, David. Pick up the prescriptions today, and we’ll see you next week for the procedure.

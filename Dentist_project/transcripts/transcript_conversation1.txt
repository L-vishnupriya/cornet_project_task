 Good morning, David. Good to see you again. I hear you're having some trouble with one of your teeth. Can you tell me what's been going on? Yeah, doctor. It started maybe like four days ago. At first, it was just a little sensitivity when I drank cold water. I thought it would go away, but yesterday it got really bad. It's this constant throbbing pain on the lower right side. Okay, lower right. And how bad is the pain right now, if 10 is the worst pain you can imagine? Right now it's around a 7, I'd say. But when I bite down, oh man, it jumps to like a 9 or even a 10. It also feels like that tooth is kind of higher than the others. That's actually helpful information. That high feeling usually means there's pressure under the tooth. Let me take a look. Open wide for me. Alright I going to tap on a few teeth here Let me know when it hurts Okay How about this one No that one okay And this one Oh yeah Yeah that it That one really hurts Alright. We did take an x-ray just before I came in. Let's look at it together on the screen. You see this dark spot here at the very tip of the root? That shadow means there's an infection, what we call a dental abscess. So does that mean the tooth is dead or something? Essentially, yes. The nerve inside the tooth, the pulp, has become necrotic, meaning it's no longer alive. The official diagnosis is symptomatic apical periodontitis. Basically, bacteria got inside the tooth and your body is reacting to it. Okay, that sounds serious. What do we do next? To save the tooth, the best option is a root canal. I know people worry about that, but honestly, with today's anesthesia, it's no worse than getting a deep filling. We clean out the infection disinfect the canals and seal everything up I mostly worried about the pain during the procedure That totally understandable We make sure you numb But because there's an active infection right now, I want to calm things down first with medication before we start the actual root canal work. Alright, what medicines will I need to take? Okay, so I'm prescribing three things. Let me explain them slowly. First, amoxicillin, 500 mg. That's 500 mg. You'll take one capsule every 8 hours, so 3 times a day, for a full 7 days. Even if you feel better in 2 or 3 days, please finish all of it. Second, ibuprofen, 600 mg. Take one tablet every 6 hours for pain and swelling. And third, if the pain is still bad, you can take acetaminophen, 500 milligrams, in between the ibuprofen doses. Just don take them at the exact same time Okay so amoxicillin three times a day ibuprofen every six hours and Tylenol in between if needed Exactly Now we should schedule the root canal. Let's see, today is Wednesday. How about Tuesday, December 23rd, around 9 in the morning. Officially it's 9 a.m. Yeah, that should work for me. Good. Until then, try to avoid chewing on the right side. Stick to soft foods. Also, avoid really hot or really cold drinks. They can make the pressure worse. What if the swelling gets worse before Tuesday? Good question. If you notice swelling spreading toward your eye or down your neck, or if you have trouble breathing or swallowing, that's an emergency. Don't wait. Otherwise, with the antibiotics, you should start feeling some relief within, say, 24 to maybe 48 hours. All right. That makes sense. Thank you, doctor. You're welcome, David. Pick up the prescriptions today, and we'll see you next week for the procedure.

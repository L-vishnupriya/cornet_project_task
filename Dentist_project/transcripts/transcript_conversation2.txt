 Good morning, Linda. It's been, let me check here, yeah, almost three years since your last cleaning. Have you noticed anything different with your gums or teeth lately? Yeah, actually, my gums bleed pretty much every time I floss, even when I brush sometimes. And they look really red and kind of swollen. My teeth also feel, uh, gritty even after brushing. Okay, that's helpful. Bleeding and that gritty feeling usually mean there's a lot of plaque and tartar buildup. When plaque isn't removed, it hardens into calculus, which you can't brush off at home. That causes inflammation in the gums. Let's do a periodontal exam to see what's going on under the gum line. Okay, let's start recording pocket depths. Tooth number two five four five millimeters Tooth number three six five six tooth fourteen seven five seven millimeters, lower front teeth, all around five millimeters with pretty heavy bleeding. I noticed you saying some high numbers. I remember before they used to say like twos and threes? Yes, exactly. In a healthy mouth, those numbers are usually between one and three millimeters. Your measurements, five, six, even seven millimeters, mean the gums have pulled away from the teeth and the bone underneath has started to shrink. Based on these numbers and what I see on your x-rays, the diagnosis is stage two grade B periodontitis. Is that the same thing as gingivitis or is it worse? Gingivitis is the early stage, just gum inflammation. Periodontitis is more serious because it includes bone loss If we don treat it the teeth can become loose over time and in some cases may need to be removed Oh okay that sounds scary What do we do to fix it The treatment is called scaling and root planing, or deep cleaning. It's different from a regular cleaning. We go below the gum line into those 5 to 7 millimeter pockets to remove the tartar from the root surfaces so the gums can heal and tighten back up. Will I need medicine for the infection? Yes. I want to support the healing with a few medications. First, doxycycline, 100 milligrams, so 100 mg. You'll take one tablet once a day for 10 days. Second, chlorhexidine gluconate, 0.12%. You'll use about 15 milliliters, that's roughly one tablespoon, swish for 30 seconds twice a day for about two weeks And after the cleaning if your gums feel sore you can use benzocaine gel 20 applied directly to the gums as needed Okay one pill a day for 10 days the mouthwash twice a day and the gel if it hurts Exactly Now because this is a deeper procedure, we'll split it into two visits so we only numb one side at a time. The right side will be done on Monday, December 29th, at about about 10.30 in the morning, officially 10.30 a.m. The left side will be the following Monday, January 5th, also at 10.30 a.m. That works for me. After those two appointments, we'll bring you back in about six weeks, so roughly a month and a half, for a re-evaluation. We'll re-measure those pockets and see how your gums responded. If things improve, you'll come in every three to four months instead of every six for maintenance cleanings. I understand. I really want to keep my teeth, so I'll do whatever's needed. That's good to hear, Linda. My assistant will give you the prescriptions and some written instructions. We'll see you on the 29th.
